    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Put simply... I'm a gamer. I could end it there quite happily and that's that. You could
      stop here and I'd tell you that that is the same impression you'd walk away with after reading
      all of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't remember the exact date in which I was introduced to gaming, but I think I can make a
      pretty accurate stab at the progression I had... Gamegear, to Playstation 2, to GBA, to SNES,
      to SEGA MegaDrive (or similar SEGA system), to a GameBoy DS, to Playstation 3, to Wii, to PC,
      to Playstation 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even though I was introduced to a computer a lot earlier than listed (I think that it was 2002 when I was
      introduced), I didn't start gaming on one properly until a lot later when I had money to burn and the PC
      gaming market really started flying with the introduction of direct downloading.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even then, that was quite late... I've only been on Steam since about July 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm sad to say that I'm one of those scumbags that prefer console gaming. I like the assurance that no-matter
      what game I get, it will run on this one box that I don't have to do anything with. However... that doesn't
      mean I hate PC gaming... I love it; I love the amount of games available at the snap of a finger at a much
      lower price than the console market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, however, I've splashed out on getting a higher spec computer that's able to do a bit more than stutter
      and start at every damn game I play. The fact that it's a desktop already puts it above my laptop, but the key
      things to note are that it's running a 6th gen i5, 16 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM, a 4GB NVIDIA 960 GTX, and a few
      bells and whistles to keep it running at a stable 28 degrees Celsius.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wanted to know about me regarding my non-gaming life... I'm a fourth year Computing Science student/weirdo
      at Newcastle University in the UK, currently specialising into distributed systems and security in computing
      because they sounded fancy on the box and present interesting problems to be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have around five years of programming experience at this point in scripted and non-scripted languages such as
      Python, C/++, Java, and PHP (there are others, but I don't really want to list them all - those are the ones that
      I've had the most recent experience in). I'd classify myself as primarily either a web developer or a C++
      developer at this point in time due to the sheer amount of time I've sunk into those areas of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently looking into doing a PhD around security which should hopefully prove interesting and keep me going
      for the next few years as the UK collapses around itself. Not quite sure about the specifics of that yet, but I'm
      hopeful that I'll be able to get it with the project I have planned (I'll probably showcase it on here at some
      point or other when I get around to finishing the development log part of the site).
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you were starting to think that I was just a boring gaming person who did programming most of the time
      (which... isn't really that far from the truth - the boring part I mean), I also have a large history of watching
      and reading stuff that goes by the genres of anime and manga (because I'm a student and I have a gargantuan
      amount of time that I should probably have spent studying which mysteriously disappeared at some point down the
      line). What I have seen/read can be seen on this site in the appropriate headings, but fair warning... my tastes
      are somewhat broad and I will watch anything that piques my interest at any point in time soooo... yeah...
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically, if you want confirmation that I'm a weirdo, give those two categories a bit of a search...
