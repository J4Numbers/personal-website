                You have reached the home of J4Numbers. This is my little space on the web where
                I can pretend to be interesting and have opinions about silly little things that
                generally don't matter.

                        My main job/profession is as a software developer. Clicking here will
                        show you some of the things that I am working on that I've bothered to
                        write up.

                        Sometimes I write words about things that interest me. Clicking here will
                        take you to some of them, at which point you can decide for yourself as to
                        how silly said words are.

                        Against my better judgement, I do not just code things unto eternity. Clicking
                        here will take you to some of my hobbies and the details around that...
